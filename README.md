# Poker Hand Classifier

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify poker hands using various machine learning algorithms. Given a set of cards represented in a dataset, we implement and compare different classifiers to determine the hand's rank.

## Features
- *Data Preprocessing*: Prepare the poker hand data for training and testing the models.
- *Model Implementation*: Utilize different machine learning algorithms:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
- *Performance Evaluation*: Compare the accuracy and efficiency of each implemented model.

## Technologies Used
- *Python*: Programming language.
- *Scikit-learn*: Machine learning library for Python.
- *Pandas*: Data manipulation and analysis library.
